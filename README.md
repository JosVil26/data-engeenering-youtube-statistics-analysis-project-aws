# YouTube Statistics Data Analytics | Data Engineering AWS Project

## Introduction
This data engineering project aims to leverage AWS services to analyze YouTube statistics. By utilizing S3 for data storage, Lambda for event-driven processing, Glue for ETL tasks, Athena for interactive querying, QuickSight for data visualization, and IAM for secure access control, we will create a robust and scalable solution to extract valuable insights from YouTube data. This project will enable us to explore trends, user behavior, and performance metrics to make data-driven decisions.
